This is the repository for Team 12 (CSCI 310 Dream Team) in USC's CSCI 310 during Spring 2021. It contains the application KeepFit.

## Short Description
KeepFit is an application intended to help users remain in shape during the COVID-19 pandemic. While everyone has been stuck inside due to social distancing, access to the tools needed to stay in shape has been limited. This application solves that problems and allows users to "keep fit" from anywhere.
